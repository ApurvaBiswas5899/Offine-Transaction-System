# Offine-Transaction-System

We have created an offline transaction system using which anyone can send and recieve money even f they are in the other half of the word without the need of connecting to the internet.

We used many technologies and learned a lot of new ones. We developed a way to connect the frontend to the backend without the use of the internet. We used cellular networks to make all the API calls.  This means that there is no need for internet connectivity at either the sender's side or the side of the receiver.
